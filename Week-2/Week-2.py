# Problem statement

Create the famous 'Frog leap' puzzle game. Try completing the game before starting to get an idea about its work.
# [Demonstration](https://www.neok12.com/games/leap-froggies/leap-froggies.htm).


### Rules ###
# 1. The left set of frogs can only move right, and the right set of frogs can only move left.
# 2. Frogs can move forward one space, or move two spaces by jumping over another frog from the opposite side.
# 3. The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have switched positions.


## Steps to solve the problem:
### Step1:-
#- Display green and brown frogs on the left and right sides initially.

#Initial Display:-  

#[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]
#['G', 'G', 'G', '-', 'B', 'B', 'B']

#<br>
#Here 'G' represents Green frogs on the left side and 'B' represents brown frogs on the right side. The '-' defines the position of an empty leaf.
#(You can change display according to your imagination or convenience)

### Step2:-
#Accept the positions of the frog that you want to move.<br>
#Example: If we enter position 2 then the game will look like this:-

#[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]
#['G', 'G', '-', 'G', 'B', 'B', 'B']


### Step3:- ###
#Define Invalid moves and add conditional 'if' statements accordingly
#### Rules
# 1. The entered position should be between 0 to 6. Or a character 'q' to quit the game.
# 2. The entered position cannot be the position of an empty leaf.
# 3. If the selected frog position cannot perform the constraints given in rule 2 then the move is invalid.

### Step4:-
# Make the appropriate move by changing the game display.

## Step 1
# First create a list of `positions` which contains the characters 'G', 'B' and '-' in the same sequence as given in the initial display state.

### your code here

positions = list(['游릴','游릴','游릴','游뤋','游릶','游릶','游릶'])

# Now print this string ```[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]``` and after that print the list `positions`

### your code here

print("[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]")
print(positions)


# Take position input from the user and write a message as `"Press q to quit else \nEnter position of the piece:"`.

### your code here

while True:
    pos = input("Press q to Quit \nEnter position of piece you want to move: ")

# Now the taken input is in string format. So first check if the input is a `'q'` character. If the input is `'q'` then the person is quitting the game so print `'You Lose'`.

### your code here

if pos == 'q':
  print("You LOSE!")
      break

# Next if the input character is not `'q'` then it has to be some integer. so convert the input to integer format.

### your code here

pos = int(pos)

## Step 2
# Now we have to check the validity of the selected positions or move.<br>
# If the entered number isn't between 0 and 6, then print 'Invalid move'.

### your code here

if pos < 0 or pos > 6:
        print("Invalid Move")
        continue

# A frog should be present in the selected position to make a move. If leaf is selected then it doesn't make sense. Therefore, if the entered position is the same as the position of the empty leaf then the move is invalid and prints `Invalid Move`

### your code here

if positions[pos] == '游뤋':
        print("Invalid Move")
        continue

# Initialize a variable named `pos2` at value 0, to store the index of empty leaf, so that we can use it later.

### your code here

pos2 = 0
 
    Check if the selected frog is 'G':
  
        # (Inside if when it's 'G'. As 'G' is selected frog can move to the right only.)
        
        仇듞ondition 1

        If **selected_position + 1** is less than or equal to 6 and **curent_position + 1** contains '-'
        then it's a valid move and store that position in `pos2`.
        
        仇듞ondition2

        Else if **selected_position + 2** is less than or equal to 6 and if **current_position + 2**
        contains '-' and if **selected_position + 1** contains 'B' then it's a valid move  and stores that position in `pos2`.
        
        仇듞ondition3:

        Else remaining all are invalid, so print `Invalid Move`
      

### your code here

if positions[pos] == '游릴':
        if (pos + 1) <= 6 and positions[pos + 1] == '游뤋':
            pass
        elif (pos + 2) <= 6 and positions[pos + 2] == '游뤋' and positions[pos + 1] == '游릶':
            pass
        else:
            print("Invalid Move")
            break

```
    Check if the selected frog is 'B':
    
        #(Inside if when it's 'B'. As 'B' is selected frog can move to left only.)
        
        仇듞ondition1:

        If **selected_position - 1** is more than or equal to 0 and **curent_position - 1** contains '-' then
        #it's a valid move and and store that position in `pos2`.
        
        仇듞ondition2:

        Else if **selected_position - 2** is more than or equal to 0 and if **current_position - 2** contains '-'
        and if **selected_position - 1** contains 'G' then it's a valid move and and store that position in `pos2`.

        仇듞ondition3:
        
        Else remaining all are invalid, so print `Invalid Move`.
        

### your code here

if positions[pos] == '游릶':
        if (pos - 1) >= 0 and positions[pos - 1] == '游뤋':
            pass
        elif (pos - 2) >= 0 and positions[pos - 2] == '游뤋' and positions[pos - 1] == '游릴':
            pass
        else:
            print("Invalid Move")
            break

#Swap the element at selected positions and calculate position2 in the list.<br> So basically we are moving the frog to the next valid position by swapping elements of an array.

### your code here
positions[pos], positions[pos2] = positions[pos2], positions[pos]

#Now print the display of the game again to see the change.<br>
#If we enter position 2 then the output will look like this:-

#[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]
#['G', 'G', '-', 'G', 'B', 'B', 'B']


### your code here
print("[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ]")
print(positions)

#Check for the winning condition by comparing the elements of a list. If a player has won the game print `'You Win'`

### your code here

if positions == ['游릶','游릶','游릶','游뤋','游릴','游릴','游릴']:
        print(" ")
        print("You WIN!")
        break

# Now the game should keep running until the player quits, so place all conditional statements inside an infinite loop.<br>

# 1. We have to `'break'` the loop if the player presses `'q'` and quits.

# 2. If the move made by a player is `'Invalid Move'` then we have to `'continue'` without executing the remaining part of the selected iteration.

# 3. If a player wins the game we have to `break` the loop.


#Infinite loop:
    (inside loop)
    1. Take input
    2. Check all valid and invalid conditions of `pos`.
    3. Make the appropriate move by calculating `pos2`.
    4. Display game
    4. Check winning condition
