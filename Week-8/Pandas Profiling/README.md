# **Pandas Profiling**

Pandas Profiling streamlines the process by generating a comprehensive report of a dataset, minimizing the time to explore the large datasets.
It is used to generate a complete and exhaustive report for the dataset, with many features and customizations in the generated report. This report includes various pieces of information such as dataset statistics, distribution of values, missing values, memory usage, etc., which are very useful for exploring and analyzing data efficiently. <br>
Pandas Profiling also helps a lot in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is used to understand the underlying structure of data, detect patterns, and generate insights in a visual format.

#### Pandas Profiling has been done on Data stats, Hourly stats and Minute stats.
