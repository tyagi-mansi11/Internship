# **Part-1: Indian Cars: Data Analysis and Visualization**

Over 3,34,000 passenger cars zoomed off dealership lots in India last May, marking a 13% jump compared to the same month in 2022. Interestingly, the top 25 best-selling models grabbed a whopping 75% share of the April 2023 market.

A massive dataset with 141 columns packed with car sales information is used. Let's delve into it using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and trends. Various charts and graphs are used to visualize the data.

Both univariate and bivariate analyses are conducted. Univariate analysis examines each variable individually, while bivariate analysis explores the relationships between two variables. This helps to understand how different factors impact car sales.


## Visualization:

Throughout the analysis, various graphs and charts are used to effectively visualise the data. The chosen visualizations will be tailored to the specific variable types and relationships examined.

### ✅Univariate analysis
Uni means one and variate means variable, so in univariate analysis, there is only one dependable variable. The objective of univariate analysis is to derive the data, define and summarize it, and analyze its pattern. A dataset explores each variable separately. It is possible for two kinds of variables- Categorical and Numerical.


### ✅Bivariate analysis
Bi means two and variate means variable, so here there are two variables. The analysis is related to the cause and the relationship between the two variables. 

## Data Statistics Performed in Univariate Analysis

<h4>Histogram: To visualize the distribution of key numeric variables.</h4> 
<h4>Count Plot: To visualize the count of observations for categorical variables.</h4>
<h4> Pie Chart: To represent the contribution of different car models or manufacturers.</h4>

## Data Statistics Performed in Bivariate Analysis

<h4>Scatter Plot: To explore the relationship between two numeric variables.</h4>
<h4>Correlation Matrix: To understand the relationship between numeric variables.</h4>
<h4>Box plot with hue: Ti introduce the 'hue' parameter to represent additional categorical variables.</h4>
<h4>Violin plot: To visualize the distribution of numeric variables across different categories.</h4>
<h4>Pair plot: For a quick overview of the relationship between multiple numeric variables.</h4>

# **Part-2: SuperStore Sales: Data Analysis and Visualization**

The dataset which is used is a retail dataset of the global superstore for 4 years. Let's delve into it using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and trends. Various charts and graphs are used to visualize the data.

Both univariate and bivariate analyses are conducted. Univariate analysis examines each variable individually, while bivariate analysis explores the relationships between two variables. This helps to understand how different factors impact store sales.

## Data Statistics Performed in Univariate Analysis

<h4>Histogram: To visualize the distribution of key numeric variables.</h4>
<h4>Sales Distribution by Category: To visualize the distribution of sales across different categories using a pie chart.</h4>
<h4>Time Series Plot: To understand the trends and patterns in sales over the 4 years.</h4>
<h4>Sales Variation over time: To observe how sales vary over different periods (months, years, quarters).</h4>

## Data Statistics Performed in Bivariate Analysis

<h4>Shipping Mode vs sales: To explore the relationship between shipping mode and sales using a pie chart.</h4>
<h4>Customer Segment Analysis: To explore sales trends for different customer segments using a bar chart</h4>
<h4>Product-wise Sales Analysis: To investigate how sales vary for different products or categories.</h4>

## Outcome:

This exploration will provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, market trends, and potential areas for further investigation.
