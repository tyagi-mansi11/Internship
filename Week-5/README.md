# Objective:

_Step into the shoes of a detective and solve a murder mystery using SQL. Additionally, embarked on a web scraping adventure to collect datasets, setting the stage for subsequent tasks in data analysis._

## ðŸ‘‰Part 1- Web Scraping Adventure:

* **Choose a Target Website:** The website named Books to scrape is used from which data was collected. 

* **Understand the Structure:** Analyzed the structure of the chosen website, identified key elements and the location of the data to be scraped.

* **Web Scraping Implementation:** Utilized Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to perform web scraping and extracted relevant data from the website and stored it in a suitable format for analysis.

#### ðŸ“Œ Source website: http://books.toscrape.com/ <br>
#### ðŸ“Œ Libraries used: BeautifulSoup, Requests and Pandas 
#### ðŸ“Œ Solution: _[Code](https://github.com/tyagi-mansi11/PrepInsta_Internship/blob/264c3ba5cf44ae605bc3e949fb55adee321016ef/Week-5/Webscraping.ipynb)_ file

## Final Result after Web Scraping

## ðŸ‘‰Part 2- SQL Detective Challenge:

* **Introduction to the Case:** Familiarised with the database of murder mystery case and understand the structure of the crime data, including tables and relationships.

* **Database Setup:** Set up an SQL database, either locally or using an online platform and create tables that align with the information provided in the murder mystery case.

* **SQL Queries:** Developed SQL queries to extract relevant information from the database using SELECT statements, JOIN operations, and WHERE clauses to uncover clues and solve the murder mystery.

* **Analysis and Conclusion:** Analyzed the results of SQL queries to piece together the sequence of events and identify potential suspects and concluded the detective challenge by summarising the findings and presenting a compelling case.
