# Air Quality Data<br>

### Brief about the dataset
Data which is used is combined(across the years and states) and is largely a clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy(NDSAP).

1. Sampling_Date (Dimension): Stores particular month and air quality report code.
2. State (Dimension): Stores name of States.
3. Location (Dimension): Stores name of cities.
4. Type (Dimension): Stores zone in which air quality measures like industrial, residential, etc.
5. NO2 (Measure): Level of Nitrogen dioxide.
6. SO2 (Measure): Level of Sulphur dioxide.
7. Rspm (Measure): Level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter.
8. Spm (Measure): Level of Suspended Particulate Matter.
9. pm2_5 (Dimension): Level between 2 and 5.
10. Date (Dimension): Stores date monthly from 1987 to 2000.

### About Air Quality Measurements
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are one of the most dangerous outdoor air pollutants. Outdoor NO2 exposure may increase the risk of respirator tract infections through the pollutant's interaction with the immune system. SO2 contributes to respiratory symptoms in both healthy patients and those with underlying pulmonary disease.<br>
Respirable Suspended Particulate Matters (RSPM) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) are produced from combustion processes, vehicles and industrial sources.

### ‚úÖAnalysis of air pollution data from 1986 to 2003 reveals several key insights:

**Industrial activity:** Industries were identified as the primary source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions.<br>
**Particulate matter:** While levels of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained relatively low until 2003, a sharp increase was observed thereafter. <br>
**Similar trends:** This upward trend in RSPM, SPM, NO2, and SO2 emissions mirrored each other, suggesting a common underlying cause.<br>
**Top polluters:** The states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Gujarat, and Himachal Pradesh emerged as the most air-polluted regions.<br>
